Streamline Cathlab Recording Workflow Using DialogFlow

## Overview:

Interventional procedures such as angioplasty, valve replacement, pacemaker implantation, ablations are performed in a cathlab. Regulatory bodies mandate documenting all the events during the procedure. For example: Vital signs, medications administered, personnel involved, equipment’s used, patient’s response, protocol followed, calculated pressures, cardiac output, Fractional Flow Reserve etc. The documentation process is a comprehensive job and one dedicated scrub nurse is responsible for it.  

Following are the current challenges:
1.	A dedicated scrub nurse causes additional expense to the hospital, procedure and the patient resulting in increased procedure cost.
2.	There are chances of misses or misinterpretation of the physician’s statements. This may be due to the following reasons:

  - Physician works in the cathlab and the documenting nurse will be seated in control room 
  - Primitive input methods are cumbersome especially in long running procedure (navigating through menu, searching through keyboards etc.)
  - Sterile cathlab environment prevents Nurse to both attending the patient and recording.

## Solution:

Following are the benefits that address the above mentioned problems.
1.	Voice based cathlab recording system with natural language processing.
2.	Physicians/Staff in the examination room can document a procedure.
3.	User can talk in his/her natural language to the system.
4.	User need not touch keyboard or mouse for documenting.

PS: Voice Assistant can play Aerosmith too. 

The user must be able to perform the following steps:
1. Document procedure steps by voice. 
For example: Add 5 mg versed, Add 5 Fr sheath, Add Dr. John, Circulating nurse Mary is replaced by Megan
2. Document hemodynamic values with voice. 
For example: Create snapshot now, Record vital signs.
